Alright, before 2023 goes bananas, let's have a look at 2022.

### Family

The year started with most of Covid restrictions being lifted, which meant I
finally got the chance to get back in touch with my family. In the last year, I have
been a record of 5 times in London, getting to spend time and reconnect with the loved ones.
It has been incredible to see my nieces and my nephew grow to know me. In the beginning,
they could barely remember me, now, I am their favorite uncle :-).

### Life

2022 got me to witness someone close to me struggling with mental issues. It got me to witness how
easily society can push you to the bottom, how easily people treat you like a freak, and how easily
they abandon you. For me, this was a wake-up call, one that I was not planning to encounter, but a
much-needed one. I realized who my true friends are and how my expectations from those friendships
didn't match the reality. It has been both disappointing and frustrating, but at least now I know
where I stand.

### Work

After almost 6 years as an Airtamer, I've changed my job twice. The first switch was to a struggling
startup that didn't have enough runway to survive the year. They hired me at the last moment, and honestly,
I'm not sure what they expected. It was too late for us to steer the boat.

The second switch came in mid-September, when I joined Corti as a frontend-focused team lead.
I've become part of an AI startup whose mission is saving lives. It's been an incredible start
so far and a reminder that every time you leave a great team behind, another one will be there for
you. All you have to do is go explore.

### What's next

I've been in a work-in-progress state for most of the second half of the year, spending time with myself,
reflecting, learning, and improving. This year, I plan to stay on the same path: one with less noise,
with honest and genuine people, and most importantly, one filled with true love and compassion.
