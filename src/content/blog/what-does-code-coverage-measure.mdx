import CodeCov from "../../components/CodeCov.astro";
export const coverage = [0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1];

This week, I was having a conversation with another engineer, and they had an
interesting remark. They claimed that devops should have some control over a
project pipeline workflow in case we impose a code coverage threshold.
Otherwise, "an engineer would be able to just lower it to pass the pipeline".
There are a few issues with this claim:

1. The change to lower the coverage threshold would show in the review, so it is
   not very easy to sneak it in.
2. An engineer can do much more damage than cheating the code coverage threshold
   in an environment governed by mistrust.
3. If the entire dev team is "evil", even if they don't have control over the
   config for the threshold, they can still easily cheat the code coverage instead.

### What does code coverage measure?

Code coverage measures **lines of code executed**, **not lines of code
validated**, as we might mistakenly expect. To cheat, one can write some unit
tests that are providing just the right input (in order to cover as many lines of
code as possible) without any consideration for the results of the code
execution. Take the following silly function as an example.

```javascript
// foo.js
function foo(...args) {
  switch (args.length) {
    case 0:
      throw new Error("Expected at least 1 param");
    case 1:
      throw new Error("Neh, 2 would do");
    case 2:
      return 2;
    case 3:
      return undef.something;

    default:
      return -1;
  }
}

module.exports = foo;
```

We can easily cover each branch of the `switch` statement by calling `foo` with
`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` arguments. We can do this in a simple `for` loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  const args = Array.from(Array(i).keys()); // [0..i]
  foo(...args);
}
```

Here is how the entire test file looks like. We guarded our function calls in a
`try/catch`, and we are only doing a dummy assertion at the end.

```javascript
// foo.test.js
const foo = require("./foo");

test("test foo", () => {
  // call test function ignoring its execution
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    try {
      const args = Array.from(Array(i).keys()); // [0..i]
      foo(...args);
    } catch {}
  }

  expect(true).toBeTruthy();
});
```

To make everyone's life easier, I put all the code together on my [GitHub
page](https://github.com/elvisvoer/code-cove-example). After installing the
dependencies and running `npm run test -- --coverage`, we will get a report
similar to the one below. We have indeed covered all the branches of the
`switch` statement, while all we asserted is if `true` is a value that is
coerced to `true` when a `boolean` is expected.

<CodeCov coverage={coverage}>
```javascript
// foo.js
function foo(...args) {
  switch (args.length) {
    case 0:
      throw new Error("Expected at least 1 param");
    case 1:
      throw new Error("Neh, 2 would do");
    case 2:
      return 2;
    case 3:
      return undef.something;

    default:
      return -1;
  }
}

module.exports = foo;
```
</CodeCov>

Nice cheat! We didn't even care that `undef.something` will throw an
`Uncaught ReferenceError: undef is not defined` exception, all the errors
were caught and the test passed.

### How does code coverage work?

When we pass `--coverage` to the test runner ([jest](https://jestjs.io/) in my
case), our code is first preprocessed to include some extra code which will do
the coverage line counting. Here is how a very simplified version of that would
look like.

```javascript
const cov = Array(18).fill(0);// foo.js
function foo(...args) {
cov[2]++;switch (args.length) {
    case 0:
cov[4]++;throw new Error("Expected at least 1 param");
    case 1:
cov[6]++;throw new Error("Neh, 2 would do");
    case 2:
cov[8]++;return 2;
    case 3:
cov[10]++;return undef.something;

    default:
cov[13]++;return -1;
  }
}

cov[17]++;module.exports = foo;
module.exports.__cov__ = cov;
```

We can now simulate our test coverage with the same loop we used earlier.

```javascript
const foo = require("./foo-cov");

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  try {
    const args = Array.from(Array(i).keys()); // [0..i]
    foo(...args);
  } catch {}
}

console.log(JSON.stringify(foo.__cov__));
```

Et voilÃ , it printed the same array that I've used to configure the [code
coverage
component](https://github.com/elvisvoer/erranto-site/blob/main/src/components/CodeCov.astro)
used earlier in the article.

````jsx
import CodeCov from "../../components/CodeCov.astro";
export const coverage = [0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1];

<CodeCov coverage={coverage}>
```javascript
// foo.js
function foo(...args) {
  switch (args.length) {
    case 0:
      throw new Error("Expected at least 1 param");
    case 1:
      throw new Error("Neh, 2 would do");
    case 2:
      return 2;
    case 3:
      return undef.something;

    default:
      return -1;
  }
}

module.exports = foo;
```
</CodeCov>
````

### Is code coverage useless then?

No, it is not. Code coverage is a great tool to help you understand how well you
are doing on testing. But, like with any type of measurements, you should take
its results with a grain of salt. For instance, [snapshot
testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) could lead to false positives
in terms of line of code covered but not properly verified. Also, imposing a
ridiculous threshold (like 98% coverage) will cause more damage that it will
help. Developers will have to start exposing aspects of the code that were
supposed to be encapsulated, just for the sake of reaching the necessary mark
needed for the pipeline to pass.

_I've never been interested in how code coverage works until my former colleague
Iryna gave us an amazing presentation about it during my time at
[Corti](https://www.corti.ai/). Thank you for that!_
