import JSSnippet from "../../components/JSSnippet.svelte"

When we lean about exception handling, and the `try/catch/finally` statements, we are
told that the `finally` block is guaranteed to always execute. Here is an example:

<JSSnippet client:load>
```js
function doSomething() {

}

try {
  doSomething();
  console.log("Done!");
  return 42;
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Got error:", e);
} finally {
  console.log("Finally!");
}
```
</JSSnippet>

The code above will successfully execute `doSomething` (the function doesn't do anything
at the moment), it will print `Done`, and then, even though there is a `return` statement,
it will print `Finally!`.

Let's see what happens if we throw an exception inside `doSomething`:

<JSSnippet client:load>
```js
function doSomething() {
  throw new Error("Nope!");
}

try {
  doSomething();
  console.log("Done!");
  return 42;
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Got error:", e);
} finally {
  console.log("Finally!");
}
```
</JSSnippet>

As expected, the exception being thrown will interrupt the execution of the
`try` block, triggering the `catch` block, which will print `Got error: Error: Nope!`.
After that, the `finally` block will execute, printing `Finally!`.

---

For synchronous code the `finally` guarantee holds true. The question is, will it also
hold true for async code? Technically yes, but with a caveat. The promise that is being
awaited needs to be resolved or rejected before the rest of the code can execute.

Let's return to our code examples and this time use async code.

<JSSnippet client:load>
```js
async function doSomething() {
  return Promise.resolve();
}

try {
  await doSomething();
  console.log("Done!");
  return 42;
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Got error:", e);
} finally {
  console.log("Finally!");
}
```
</JSSnippet>

Just like in our first example, `doSomething` will successfully resolve with
`undefined`, after which the rest of the code will execute, printing `Done!`
followed by `Finally!`.

If we reject from `doSomething` the result will be similar with the second sync
code example:

<JSSnippet client:load>
```js
async function doSomething() {
  return Promise.reject(new Error("Nope"));
}

try {
  await doSomething();
  console.log("Done!");
  return 42;
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Got error:", e);
} finally {
  console.log("Finally!");
}
```
</JSSnippet>

In both our examples, the promise has settled, which allowed the execution of
the rest of the code to continue. However, in the recent months, I have stumbled
upon a situation where the promise never settled. We nicknamed that bug the
`try/catch/maybe` bug. Here is how it looks like.

<JSSnippet client:load>
```js
const someCondition = false; 
async function doSomething() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    if (someCondition) {
      resolve(); // never resolves because our condition is `false`
    }
  });
}

try {
  await doSomething();
  console.log("Done!");
  return 42;
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Got error:", e);
} finally {
  console.log("Finally!");
}
```
</JSSnippet>

It's not rocket science, but it took us a little bit of debugging until
we realized that we are not resolving our promises. That's why I advice to be careful
when using conditionals in the `new Promise` constructor handler.
