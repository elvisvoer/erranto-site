import JSSnippet from "../../components/JSSnippet.svelte"

It has been a very long time since I last had to deal with hoisting in
JavaScript. If my memory serves me correctly, it had something to do with [using
ES module imports in
Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks#using-with-es-module-imports). Oh
man... I have never enjoyed using Jest. It always felt like I needed to fight it
to get it to do what I want. Or maybe it was just "skill issue".

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and voilà — JavaScript hoisting strikes again.
This time, it had to do with Internet Explorer (IE)
[polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill). Yep, IE
— that old thing that made our lives as web developers a little bit more
"_colorful_". If you ever had to write code to support it, I bet you remember
having to include a gazillion polyfills just to make it behave like the rest of
the browsers.

Luckily for us, [Microsoft ended support for IE 11 on June 25,
2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support),
and has encouraged its users to move to the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge. This
means we no longer needed to include the polyfills, and we could, therefore,
remove a couple of hundred lines of code from our bundle. Easy peasy — except
our Cypress tests running on Chrome started to fail. Whoot?? How does removing
IE polyfills make Chrome tests fail? The short answer...

  JavaScript" />

For the long answer, we will have to dive into how the scope works in
JavaScript, what is hoisting, and how the polyfill detection phase was
implemented. So let's get started.

## JavaScript scope and hoisting

Most of the bad reputation that the language gets is coming from the way the
scope was implemented and how hard it is to rationalize about the value of the
`this` reference. Up until the introduction of the array functions, it was very
common to see code like `var that = this;` or `var self = this`. Anyway, it will
take too much space to cover the quirks of the `this` keyword here, so I will
only focus on simple variables and functions.

Traditionally, variable declaration was done using the `var` keyword. If a
variable is declared but not initialized, it will by default have an `undefined`
value.

<JSSnippet client:load>
```js
var name = "Moo";
var uninitialized;

console.log(name);
console.log(uninitialized);
```
</JSSnippet>

So far, so good. We have created two variables and printed their values. The
`name` variable was given an initial value, while we left the `uninitialized`
variable, well... uninitialized. Things start to make less sense when you
encounter code similar to the one below.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte" showLineNumbers={true}>
```js
function fun(cond) {
  if (cond) {
    var someValue = "some-value";
  }

  console.log(someValue);
}

fun(true);
fun(false);
```
</JSSnippet>

In a sane programming language, you'd expect line 6 to throw an error like
`ReferenceError: someValue is not defined`. Not in JavaScript, though! Before
the introduction of `let` and `const`, a variable would belong to one of two
scopes:

- _function scope_, if the variable was declared inside a function;
- _global scope_, if the variable was declared outside of a function.

In the scenario above, `someValue` is visible throughout the function scope even
though it was declared inside an `if` block. This is what we refer to as
**_hoisting_**: a variable declared with `var` is visible from the beginning of
its scope regardless of the position in code where it was declared. 

To make things worse, if you by mistake omit the `var` keyword (e.g. you
misspell the variable name), you will create a global variable.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte" showLineNumbers={true}>
```js
function fun(cond) {
  var someValue;

  if (cond) {
    somValue = "some-value"; // misspelled
  }

  console.log(someValue);
}

fun(true); // creates global variable 'somValue'
fun(false);

console.log(somValue); // misspelled again, prints 'some-value'
```
</JSSnippet>

### Strict mode

One way to prevent such mistakes is to use [strict
mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).
In strict mode, line 7 throws `ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable
somValue`:

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte" showLineNumbers={true}>
```js
"use strict";

function fun(cond) {
  var someValue;

  if (cond) {
    somValue = "some-value"; // misspelled, but throws an error
  }

  console.log(someValue);
}

fun(true);
fun(false);

console.log(somValue);
```
</JSSnippet>

While I recommend to always use strict mode, it does not help us with hoisting
issues. Take the following code as an example: `someValue` is still hoisted, and
line 4 will simply print `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte" showLineNumbers={true}>
```js
"use strict";

function fun() {
  console.log(someValue);

  {
    var someValue = "some-value"; // variable is declared inside a block
  }

  console.log(someValue);
}

fun();
```
</JSSnippet>

### Let and const

To fix the issues that come from using the var keyword, JavaScript introduced
two ways of declaring block-scoped variables: `let` and `const`. `let` is used
when we want to reassign the variable later, while `const` is used when we never
need to reassign it. Keep in mind that `const` only prevents reassignment; it
**does not** make the variable immutable.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte">
```js
const person = {
  name: "Moo"
}

person.name = "Foo"; // mutates the name property of our object

console.log(JSON.stringify(person, undefined, 2));

```
</JSSnippet>

Let's return to our previous example and see if `const` will make our code more
predictable.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte">
```js
function fun() {
  // throws `ReferenceError: someValue is not defined` because `someValue` is only visible within its block
  console.log(someValue);

  { // `someValue` is only visible inside this block
    const someValue = "some-value";
  }

  console.log(someValue);
}

fun();
```
</JSSnippet>

What about hoisting, is that also fixed? Oh well, line 3 finally throws an error!

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte" showLineNumbers={true}>
```js
function fun() {
  // throws `ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'someValue' before initialization`
  console.log(someValue);

  const someValue = "some-value";

  console.log(someValue);
}

fun();
```
</JSSnippet>

With `let` and `const` we are in a much better place: variables
are only visible in the block where they were declared, and we receive an error
if we try to access a variable before its declaration.

## The MouseEvent polyfill

Now that we have seen some of the quirks of JavaScript, we can return to our
main story. Back when the team had to support IE, they ran into the typical API
differences that required the use of a polyfill. In this case, it was the
`MouseEvent` polyfill, as can be seen on this
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28815845/mouseevent-not-working-in-internet-explorer)
page. [One of the answers](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43640602/3415496) there
suggest that there is already a polyfill available on Mozilla Developer Network
(MDN), "except that the try catch block in that code needs to look like this":

```javascript
try {
  new CustomEvent('test');
  return false; // No need to polyfill
} catch (e) {
  // Need to polyfill - fall through
}
```

The polyfill has been removed from the main MDN website, but I managed to find
it in [a GitHub
repository](https://github.com/msn0/mdn-polyfills/blob/master/src/MouseEvent/MouseEvent.js),
and it looks **almost** identical to the one we were using:

```javascript
export default function () {
    try {
        new MouseEvent('test');
        return false; // No need to polyfill
    } catch (e) {
        // Need to polyfill - fall through
    }

    // Polyfills DOM4 MouseEvent
    var MouseEvent = function (eventType, params) {
        params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false };
        var mouseEvent = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');
        mouseEvent.initMouseEvent(eventType,
            params.bubbles,
            params.cancelable,
            window,
            0,
            params.screenX || 0,
            params.screenY || 0,
            params.clientX || 0,
            params.clientY || 0,
            params.ctrlKey || false,
            params.altKey || false,
            params.shiftKey || false,
            params.metaKey || false,
            params.button || 0,
            params.relatedTarget || null
        );

        return mouseEvent;
    };

    MouseEvent.prototype = Event.prototype;

    window.MouseEvent = MouseEvent;
}
```

At first glance, the code looks correct, although, as one of my colleagues
pointed out, "the `try/catch` block is trying to be a little too smart." And he
was absolutely right. If we learned anything from the previous section, it's
that a variable declared with var will be hoisted to the beginning of the
function. Let's add a console log in the `catch` block and see what error we get.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte" showLineNumbers={true}>
```js
function fun() {
    try {
        new MouseEvent('test');
        return false; // No need to polyfill
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        // Need to polyfill - fall through
    }

    // Polyfills DOM4 MouseEvent
    var MouseEvent = function (eventType, params) {
        params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false };
        var mouseEvent = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');
        mouseEvent.initMouseEvent(eventType,
            params.bubbles,
            params.cancelable,
            window,
            0,
            params.screenX || 0,
            params.screenY || 0,
            params.clientX || 0,
            params.clientY || 0,
            params.ctrlKey || false,
            params.altKey || false,
            params.shiftKey || false,
            params.metaKey || false,
            params.button || 0,
            params.relatedTarget || null
        );

        return mouseEvent;
    };

    MouseEvent.prototype = Event.prototype;

    window.MouseEvent = MouseEvent;
}

fun();
```
</JSSnippet>

`TypeError: MouseEvent is not a constructor` — there we have it! The new
implementation for the `MouseEvent` will hoist, and line 3 will call `new` on an
`undefined` value, instead of a constructor. This meant that the polyfill was
always applied, regardless of the browser used. The version of the polyfill that
I linked earlier uses a different name for the polyfill implementation
(`MouseEventPolyfill`), so the name collision due to hoisting won't happen.

<JSSnippet client:only="svelte">
```js
function fun() {
    try {
        new MouseEvent('test');
        console.log('No need to apply the polyfill');
        return false; // No need to polyfill
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        // Need to polyfill - fall through
    }

    // Polyfills DOM4 MouseEvent
    var MouseEventPolyfill = function (eventType, params) {
        params = params || { bubbles: false, cancelable: false };
        var mouseEvent = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');
        mouseEvent.initMouseEvent(eventType,
            params.bubbles,
            params.cancelable,
            window,
            0,
            params.screenX || 0,
            params.screenY || 0,
            params.clientX || 0,
            params.clientY || 0,
            params.ctrlKey || false,
            params.altKey || false,
            params.shiftKey || false,
            params.metaKey || false,
            params.button || 0,
            params.relatedTarget || null
        );

        return mouseEvent;
    };

    MouseEventPolyfill.prototype = Event.prototype;

    window.MouseEvent = MouseEventPolyfill;
}

fun();
```
</JSSnippet>

Once we realized that our polyfill was always applied and that our tests were
relying on its API, we reworked the tests using the Cypress `trigger` API, and we
were happy again.

It had been ages since I last dealt with a bug caused by hoisting, and this
incident reminded me of the old days of working with JavaScript. I'm glad we've
come such a long way since then.
