**How many TDD practitioners does it take to change a light bulb?** _They don't
change the bulb; they refactor the darkness!_

## Introduction

I have asked ChatGPT to tell me some jokes about test-driven development (TDD)
and out of 12 generated answers none included unicorns. That's a bit of a
disappointment considering how similar they are. Everyone is a big advocate of
TDD and how great it is but I am yet to find a team that practices it
consistently.

Ironically, I've chosen to join the advocates group by documenting a
step-by-step [TDD implementation of the NodeJS Path
module](https://github.com/elvisvoer/b-path). But before we dive in, you might
be wondering, _**'What is test-driven development?'**_ I have asked ChatGPT to
answer this question for you, and here is the result:

```markdown
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which tests
are written before the actual code implementation. The TDD process typically
follows these steps:

1. **Write a Test**: Before writing any code, a developer creates a test that
defines a specific function or improvement of the software.

2. **Run the Test**: The newly created test is executed, and it should fail
because the corresponding code to fulfill the requirements hasn't been
implemented yet.

3. **Write Code**: The developer writes the minimum amount of code necessary to
pass the test. The primary goal is to make the test pass, not to create a
fully-featured solution.

4. **Run Tests**: After writing the code, all tests, including the new one, are
executed to ensure that the recent changes haven't broken any existing
functionality.

5. **Refactor Code**: If necessary, the code is refactored to improve its
structure, readability, or efficiency. At each step, the tests are rerun to make
sure that the changes haven't introduced errors.

6. **Repeat**: Steps 1-5 are repeated iteratively for each new piece of
functionality.

TDD is designed to promote a more robust and maintainable codebase by ensuring
that every piece of code has corresponding tests and that new features or
changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
```

Pretty straight forward, right? TDD not only fosters a more robust and
maintainable codebase but also mitigates the impact of "implementation bias"
(status quo bias). This cognitive bias occurs when a programmer is influenced by
existing code while crafting a new unit of code.

Consider this scenario: I've created a function tasked with parsing and
processing an array of strings (we will actually write that later on in the
`path.resolve` implementation). If I initially write the code without accounting
for certain corner cases, chances are high that I'll overlook those same
scenarios when crafting the corresponding tests. Also, another programmer aiming
to enhance code coverage may be willing to write unit tests for my
implementation. Their focus could be on ensuring each statement is executed at
least once, potentially achieving [full unit
coverage](/blog/what-does-code-coverage-measure) without a comprehensive
understanding of the implementation details. Consequently, they might overlook
the same corner cases that eluded me as the original author.

Additionally, having a test-first approach will ensure less coupling between
your components, and a better design of public interfaces.

## Project setup

The project is configured as a basic JavaScript module without any build steps.
The  [initial
commit](https://github.com/elvisvoer/b-path/commit/ea3654dc4da7d8e03e2947d3834f023a086ddd9e)
introduces the necessary GitHub workflow to execute the pipeline, establishes a
straightforward test setup utilizing the [built-in NodeJS test
runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html), and uses a simple forwarding
mechanism for the `node:path` module (as a starting point):

```javascript
// lib/b-path.js
import path from "node:path";

export default path;
```

## The TDD approach

We are now ready to add our first tests and [make sure they
fail](https://github.com/elvisvoer/b-path/actions/runs/7585405770/job/20661199864)
by swapping our forwarding implementation with an empty one. Here is how
that looks like:

```javascript
// tests/b-path.test.js
import { describe, it } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import bPath from "../lib/b-path.js";

describe("b-path", () => {
  describe("POSIX", () => {
    it("path.delimiter should provide the path delimiter", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(bPath.delimiter, ":");
    });

    it("path.sep should provide the path separator", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(bPath.sep, "/");
    });
  });
});
```

```javascript
// lib/b-path.js
const posix = {
  posix: null,
  win32: null,
};

posix.posix = posix;

export default posix;
```

Note that we will only focus on the POSIX implementation and completely ignore
the Win32 API. With that in mind, we can now move to _**Step 3**_ and write the
actual code, [making the tests
pass](https://github.com/elvisvoer/b-path/actions/runs/7585416343/job/20661237405).
This is as simple as adding the two missing properties to our `posix` object.

<CodeBlock info={firstChange} print={print}>
```javascript
// lib/b-path.js
const posix = {
  delimiter: ":",
  sep: "/",
  posix: null,
  win32: null,
};
```
</CodeBlock>

### path.isAbsolute(path)

Moving on to `path.isAbsolute`, we'll once again start with an empty
implementation and write some tests based on [the official
documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#pathisabsolutepath).

<CodeBlock info={isAbsoluteEmpty} print={print}>
```javascript
// lib/b-path.js
const posix = {
  isAbsolute: () => {},

  delimiter: ":",
  sep: "/",
  posix: null,
  win32: null,
};
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

<CodeBlock info={isAbsoluteTests} print={print}>
```javascript
// tests/b-path.test.js
import { describe, it } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import bPath from "../lib/b-path.js";
describe("b-path", () => {
  describe("POSIX", () => {
    it("path.delimiter should provide the path delimiter", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(bPath.delimiter, ":");
    });
    it("path.sep should provide the path separator", () => {
      assert.strictEqual(bPath.sep, "/");
    });

    // input | expected result
    [
      ["", false],
      [".", false],
      ["foo/", false],
      ["foo.bar", false],
      ["/foo/bar", true],
      ["/baz/..", true],
    ].forEach(([input, result]) => {
      it(`path.isAbsolute("${input}") should return '${result}'`, () => {
        assert.strictEqual(bPath.isAbsolute(input), result);
      });
    });
  });
});
```
</CodeBlock>

_**Step 3**_ rightfully emphasizes that "_The primary objective is to ensure the
test passes, rather than creating a fully-featured solution_". As you can see, I
haven't written any tests to address scenarios where the input is not a
`string` and we must raise a `TypeError`. We can incorporate those tests at a
later stage, but for now, let's focus on making our existing tests pass.

<CodeBlock info={isAbsoluteImpl} print={print}>
```javascript
// lib/b-path.js
const posix = {
  /**
   * The isAbsolute() method determines if input path is an absolute path.
   * @param {string} path - input path
   * @returns {boolean}
   */
  isAbsolute: (path) => {
    return !!path && path.charCodeAt(0) === posix.sep.charCodeAt(0);
  },

  delimiter: ":",
  sep: "/",
  posix: null,
  win32: null,
};
```
</CodeBlock>

Running all tests (_**Step 4**_) will output the following results:

```bash
> b-path@0.0.0 test
> node --test tests

▶ b-path
  ▶ POSIX
    ✔ path.delimiter should provide the path delimiter (0.745045ms)
    ✔ path.sep should provide the path separator (0.164463ms)
    ✔ path.isAbsolute("") should return 'false' (0.186978ms)
    ✔ path.isAbsolute(".") should return 'false' (0.125469ms)
    ✔ path.isAbsolute("foo/") should return 'false' (0.250108ms)
    ✔ path.isAbsolute("foo.bar") should return 'false' (0.204638ms)
    ✔ path.isAbsolute("/foo/bar") should return 'true' (1.390664ms)
    ✔ path.isAbsolute("/baz/..") should return 'true' (0.16196ms)
  ▶ POSIX (4.772938ms)

▶ b-path (6.41931ms)

```

### The not-so-happy path

Our current code and tests cover the "happy path" where the input is provided
as expected. Now, let's address the "not-so-happy path" and consider various
input types. As always, we'll start with the tests first.

<CodeBlock info={assertStringTests} print={print}>
```javascript
// tests/b-path.test.js
import { describe, it } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import bPath from "../lib/b-path.js";
describe("b-path", () => {
  describe("POSIX", () => {
    // ...

    [undefined, null, NaN, 42, BigInt(42), {}, [], Symbol(), false].forEach(
      (input) => {
        it(`path.isAbsolute should throw TypeError if input type is ${typeof input}`, () => {
          assert.throws(
            () => {
              bPath.isAbsolute(input);
            },
            {
              name: "TypeError",
              message: `The "path" argument must be of type string. Received ${typeof input}`,
            }
          );
        });
      }
    );
  });
});
```
</CodeBlock>

And then proceed with the actual implementation.

<CodeBlock info={assertStringImpl} print={print}>
```javascript
// lib/b-path.js
/**
 * The assertIsString() function verifies whether the input is a string,
 * throwing a TypeError otherwise.
 * @param {*} input
 * @throws {TypeError}
 */
function assertIsString(input) {
  if (typeof input !== "string") {
    throw new TypeError(
      `The "path" argument must be of type string. Received ${typeof input}`
    );
  }
}

const posix = {
  /**
   * The isAbsolute() method determines if input path is an absolute path.
   * @param {string} path - input path
   * @returns {boolean}
   */
  isAbsolute: (path) => {
    assertIsString(path);
    return !!path && path.charCodeAt(0) === posix.sep.charCodeAt(0);
  },

  // ...
};
```
</CodeBlock>

_That's all for now. I will continue tomorrow with some of the other
methods and edit this post to document the journey._
