After the end of the summer I finally managed to focus on some personal projects. I must admit, I've been
shuffling quite a bit but I kept most of my focus around programming languages, compilers, interpreters,
and the `gnome-terminal`.

I got to play with `figlet` and `cowsay`, and to write a little "runner" for a "moo script".
I basically created little slideshows in the terminal. It was fun :).

All this has inspired me to finally create my own place for writing and experimenting and to do so I chose
to learn [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) -- because it allows a combination of markdown, react, and modern
theming to create a simple website.

48 hours later, I conclude this message with commit number 47.
