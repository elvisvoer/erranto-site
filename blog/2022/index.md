Alright, before 2023 goes bananas, let's have a look at 2022.

## Family

The year started with most of Covid restrictions being lifted, which meant I
finally got the chance to get back in touch with my family. In the last year, I have
been a record of 5 times in London, getting to spend time and reconnect with the loved ones.
It has been incredible to see my nieces and my nephew grow to know me. In the beginning,
they could barely remember me, now, I am their favorite uncle :-).

## Life

2022 got me to witness someone close to me struggling with mental issues. It got me to witness
how easily the society pushes you to the bottom, how easily people threat you like a freak, and
how easily they abandon you. For me, this was a wake up call, one that I was not planning to encounter,
but a much needed one. I got to realize who my true friends are and how my expectations from those
friendships didn't quite match the reality. It has been equally disappointing and frustrating
but, at least, now I know where I stand.

## Work

After almost 6 years of being an Airtamer, I have done the change and switched my job twice.
First switch was joining a struggling startup that didn't have enough runaway to survive the year. They
got me in the last moment and, honestly, I am not sure what they've expected. It was way too late for us to steer the boat.

Second switch came in mid September, I have joined Corti as a Frontend-focused team lead and got to be part of an AI
startup who's mission is saving lives. It has been an incredible start so far and a reminder that every time you leave
a great team behind, another one will be there for you. All you have to do is go explore.

## What's next

I've been in a work-in-progress state for most of the second half of the year. I got to spend time with myself, reflect,
learn, and improve. This year, I am planning to keep on the same path, one with less noise, with honest and genuine people,
and, most importantly, one filled with true love and compassion.
