I remember the early days of social media interaction when I would got to an internet cafe
just to have a chat on mIRC with someone from my community. If I was lucky, I would even get to
have a blind date. Those years seem like ages ago and a lot has changed, gone are the days
of mIRC, HI5, MySpace, and Yahoo Messenger.

I've never been a big fan of Twitter so my social media activity revolved around Facebook,
Facebook Messenger and Instagram. With Instagram I had a somehow healthy relationship. Since
I have joined the platform back in 2016, I have decided to only post pictures that have a
meaningful story behind them. That usually meant I will only post a few times a year. But still,
here I was checking the app multiple times a day and knowing almost all the stories posted by the
people I follow. Not the best use of my time and a somehow addictive behavior.

This year, on the other hand, has been a time for change and part of it has been tying to disconnect
from all the noise and distractions that consume my time. In June I have deleted Facebook and Facebook
Messenger, and this month I have deleted my main Instagram account (I still have an "arty" one). In the
beginning I felt like a void, like something was missing. But after a while that void feels like a
relief. I get more time to focus on the things that matter and have meaningful the conversations I so much
enjoy. I totally recommend it :-)
